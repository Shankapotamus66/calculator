# calculator
Here are three calculators I built in three different langauges.
1. calculator.py (Python)
2. Calculator.java (Java)
3. calculator.perl (Perl)

The Python and Java have a simple GUI and the perl is a command line based calculator.

Python calculator uses the eval() function to perform computation.

The Java calculator uses an import feature that imports JavaScript to use the eval() function to perform computation.
